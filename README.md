This code simulates a scenario where Bender from Futurama performs a heist and must then find the exit to a maze laden with traps. It is designed to take in a rectangular map of characters. It first takes in the width and height of the map, and then the map itself as input. An unlimited number of maps can be input as long as they end in 0 0 to signal the programs end. The map is made of a dynamically allocated character array which should consist of walls '#', bender 'B', open spaces ' ', traps 'T', and one exit 'E'. The program uses the map class to pathfind from the location of bender to the exit using a greedy recursive algorithm.
